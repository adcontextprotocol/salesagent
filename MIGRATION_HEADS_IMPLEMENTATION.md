# Migration Heads Detection - Implementation Guide

## Quick Start

Install the solution in 2 steps:

```bash
# 1. Install git hooks (includes migration head checking)
cd /Users/brianokelley/Developer/salesagent/.conductor/salvador
./scripts/setup/install_git_hooks.sh

# 2. Update pre-commit hooks (already done in this commit)
cd /Users/brianokelley/Developer/salesagent
pre-commit install
```

That's it! You're protected.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Detection Script: `scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py`
**Purpose:** Core logic to detect and auto-merge multiple Alembic heads.

**Features:**
- Detects multiple heads in <1 second
- Can auto-create merge migrations
- Quiet mode for CI/hooks
- Exit codes for scripting

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check only
uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py

# Auto-fix
uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py --fix

# Quiet (for hooks)
uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py --quiet
```

### 2. Auto-Merge Script: `scripts/ops/auto_merge_migrations.sh`
**Purpose:** Interactive wrapper for merge migration creation.

**Features:**
- Interactive prompts (can be disabled for CI)
- Automatic git staging and committing
- Helpful error messages
- Safe defaults

**Usage:**
```bash
# Interactive
./scripts/ops/auto_merge_migrations.sh

# Non-interactive (CI)
CI=1 ./scripts/ops/auto_merge_migrations.sh
```

### 3. Pre-Commit Hook
**File:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (updated)

**What it does:**
- Runs on every `git commit`
- Checks for multiple heads
- Blocks commit if detected
- Fast (<1 second)

**Added hook:**
```yaml
- id: check-migration-heads
  name: Check for multiple Alembic migration heads
  entry: uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py --quiet
  language: system
  pass_filenames: false
  always_run: true
```

### 4. Pre-Push Hook
**File:** `scripts/setup/install_git_hooks.sh` (new)

**What it does:**
- Runs on every `git push`
- Checks migration heads BEFORE running tests
- Offers to auto-merge
- Blocks push if multiple heads detected

**Install:**
```bash
./scripts/setup/install_git_hooks.sh
```

### 5. Documentation
**File:** `docs/database-migrations-best-practices.md` (new)

**Contents:**
- Complete explanation of the problem
- Why it happens
- How to prevent it
- How to fix it
- Best practices for team development
- Troubleshooting guide

## How It Works

### Multi-Layered Defense

```
Developer Workflow:
  ↓
  git commit
  ↓
  [Pre-Commit Hook] ← First check (blocks commit)
  ↓ (if pass)
  git push
  ↓
  [Pre-Push Hook] ← Second check (blocks push, offers auto-merge)
  ↓ (if pass)
  GitHub
  ↓
  [CI] ← Final check (should never fail if hooks work)
```

### Prevention Strategy

1. **Immediate Detection** (pre-commit)
   - Catches multiple heads when they're created
   - Developer fixes before committing
   - Fastest feedback loop

2. **Final Safety Net** (pre-push)
   - Catches heads before reaching remote
   - Offers to auto-merge
   - Prevents CI failures

3. **Manual Tools** (when needed)
   - Emergency fixes
   - CI automation
   - Team recovery procedures

## Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Pre-Commit Hook
```bash
# Should run automatically on commit
git add .
git commit -m "Test commit"
# Watch for: "Check for multiple Alembic migration heads..."

# Manually test
pre-commit run check-migration-heads --all-files
```

### Test 2: Detection Script
```bash
# Check current status
uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py

# Expected output if single head:
# ✅ Single migration head: abc123

# Expected output if multiple heads:
# ⚠️  Multiple migration heads detected: abc123, def456
```

### Test 3: Auto-Merge (Simulated)
```bash
# Create a test scenario with multiple heads
# (Don't do this on real code!)

# 1. Create branch from old commit
git checkout -b test-branch HEAD~5

# 2. Create a test migration
uv run alembic revision -m "Test migration 1"

# 3. Switch back and create another
git checkout -
uv run alembic revision -m "Test migration 2"

# 4. Merge the branch
git merge test-branch --no-commit

# 5. Now you have multiple heads - test detection
uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py
# Should detect multiple heads

# 6. Auto-merge
uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py --fix
# Should create merge migration

# 7. Clean up
git reset --hard HEAD
git branch -D test-branch
```

### Test 4: Pre-Push Hook
```bash
# Should run automatically on push
git push origin your-branch
# Watch for: "🔍 Checking Alembic migration heads..."

# If multiple heads detected:
# - Hook will block push
# - Offer to auto-merge
# - Give clear instructions
```

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Before This Implementation
```bash
# Developer workflow (BAD)
git checkout -b feature/new-thing
# ... make changes ...
uv run alembic revision -m "Add table"
git commit -m "Add feature"
git push
# ❌ CI fails with "Multiple head revisions"
# 😢 Manual fix required, delays merge
```

### After This Implementation
```bash
# Developer workflow (GOOD)
git checkout -b feature/new-thing
# ... make changes ...
uv run alembic revision -m "Add table"
git commit -m "Add feature"
# ✅ Pre-commit hook runs, catches multiple heads
# 🔧 Auto-fix offered
uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py --fix
git add alembic/versions/*merge*.py
git commit --amend --no-edit
# ✅ Fixed before push!
```

## Configuration Options

### Disable Pre-Commit Check (Not Recommended)
```bash
# Skip all hooks (not recommended)
git commit --no-verify

# Or edit .pre-commit-config.yaml and change:
always_run: false  # instead of true
```

### Disable Pre-Push Check (Not Recommended)
```bash
# Skip hooks
git push --no-verify

# Or edit .git/hooks/pre-push and comment out migration check
```

### CI Integration
Add to your CI workflow (GitHub Actions, etc.):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
jobs:
  test:
    steps:
      # ... setup steps ...

      - name: Check migration heads
        run: |
          uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py --quiet
        # Fails CI if multiple heads detected

      # ... rest of tests ...
```

## Maintenance

### Updating the Scripts
Scripts are in `scripts/ops/`:
- `check_migration_heads.py` - Core detection logic
- `auto_merge_migrations.sh` - Interactive merge tool

Both are version-controlled and can be updated like any code.

### Updating the Hooks
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks (managed by pre-commit framework)
pre-commit autoupdate  # Updates versions
pre-commit install     # Reinstalls

# Pre-push hooks (manual installation)
./scripts/setup/install_git_hooks.sh  # Reinstalls
```

### Monitoring Effectiveness
Track in your team:
- How often multiple heads are detected?
- How often auto-merge is used?
- Any CI failures from multiple heads?

Goal: Zero CI failures from multiple heads after implementation.

## Rollback Plan

If this causes problems, you can disable it:

### Temporary Disable
```bash
# Disable pre-commit check
export SKIP=check-migration-heads
git commit ...

# Disable pre-push check
git push --no-verify
```

### Permanent Rollback
```bash
# 1. Remove pre-commit hook
# Edit .pre-commit-config.yaml and delete:
#   - id: check-migration-heads
#     ...

# 2. Restore old pre-push hook
cd /Users/brianokelley/Developer/salesagent
git checkout HEAD~1 -- .git/hooks/pre-push

# 3. Remove scripts (optional)
rm scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py
rm scripts/ops/auto_merge_migrations.sh
rm scripts/setup/install_git_hooks.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install the hooks** (if not done):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup/install_git_hooks.sh
   ```

2. **Test it works**:
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py
   ```

3. **Read the documentation**:
   ```bash
   cat docs/database-migrations-best-practices.md
   ```

4. **Share with team**:
   - Send link to docs
   - Mention in next team meeting
   - Add to onboarding docs

5. **Monitor effectiveness**:
   - Track CI failures from migrations
   - Should go to zero after this

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `docs/database-migrations-best-practices.md`
2. Run `uv run python scripts/ops/check_migration_heads.py` manually
3. Review `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for hook configuration
4. Check `.git/hooks/pre-push` for hook installation
