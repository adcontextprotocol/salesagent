"""Test that inline creatives flow through all adapters correctly.

This test verifies that when inline creatives are provided in create_media_buy:
1. They get uploaded and stored (via process_and_upload_package_creatives)
2. The creative_ids get merged into packages
3. The adapter receives packages with creative_ids
4. The adapter returns packages with creative_ids in the response
5. The creative_ids can be used for creative assignments

This is a critical integration point between the creative upload flow and adapter responses.
