"""Test schema adapters - simple API on top of generated schemas.

These tests demonstrate:
1. Adapters provide simple API (like manual schemas)
2. Under the hood, they use generated schemas (spec-compliant)
3. Custom validators still work
4. Backward compatibility is preserved
5. Tests don't break when spec changes (auto-regenerate schemas)
