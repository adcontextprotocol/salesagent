# Test Agent Downtime - October 12, 2025

**Date**: 2025-10-12 @ 8:40 PM PST
**Status**: ‚ùå INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE - Test agent is completely down
**Impact**: All test agent operations timing out

## Investigation Summary

### Health Check Results

Tested all endpoints of `https://test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org`:

| Endpoint | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Root (`/`) | ‚ùå TIMEOUT | 5+ seconds, no response |
| Agent Card (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`) | ‚ùå TIMEOUT | 5+ seconds, no response |
| A2A Endpoint (`/a2a`) | ‚ùå TIMEOUT | 10+ seconds, no response |

### Network Connectivity

‚úÖ **DNS Resolution**: Working
- Resolves to: `104.21.24.70`, `172.67.217.91`

‚úÖ **ICMP Ping**: Working
- Average latency: ~13ms
- 0% packet loss

‚ùå **Application Layer**: Not responding
- TCP connections established (likely load balancer)
- HTTP requests hang indefinitely
- No response from application

### Root Cause

**Infrastructure issue on test agent side.** The application is down or unresponsive:
- Network layer (DNS, ping) works fine
- Load balancer accepting connections
- Application not processing requests

### Impact Assessment

**Currently Blocked:**
- All test agent API calls
- Media buy creation via test agent
- Webhook delivery verification
- Any A2A communication with test agent

**Working Normally:**
- Our sales agent server (localhost:8001, localhost:8080, localhost:8091)
- Our webhook delivery service
- All other functionality

### Historical Context

**Previously Working:**
- Test agent was functional earlier today
- Successfully created media buys: `buy_A2A-39dae4d5`, `buy_A2A-1f7e84ef`
- Response times were <1 second
- **Something changed between then and now**

## Our System's Behavior

### Timeout Configuration

Our webhook delivery service uses:
```python
# src/services/webhook_delivery_service.py:485
with httpx.Client(timeout=10.0) as client:
    response = client.post(config.url, json=payload, headers=headers)
```

**Current timeout: 10 seconds**

### Circuit Breaker Behavior

Our system has circuit breakers to handle failing endpoints:
- After 5 consecutive failures ‚Üí Circuit OPEN (reject requests)
- After 60 seconds in OPEN ‚Üí Move to HALF_OPEN (test recovery)
- After 2 successes in HALF_OPEN ‚Üí Circuit CLOSED (normal operation)

**This prevents cascading failures but doesn't solve the root cause.**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Contact test agent maintainers** - Infrastructure issue on their side
2. **Check status page** (if available) for test-agent.adcontextprotocol.org
3. **Use mock adapter for testing** - Switch to mock adapter for development:
   ```bash
   # In our system, use mock adapter instead of test agent
   # Mock adapter simulates responses without external calls
   ```

### Monitoring Improvements

Consider adding:
1. **Health check endpoint monitoring** - Periodically ping test agent health
2. **Alerting on circuit breaker state** - Alert when circuits open
3. **Fallback mechanisms** - Auto-switch to mock adapter when external agent down

### Configuration Changes (Optional)

Could increase timeout for more resilience, but won't help if agent is completely down:
```python
# Could increase to 30s for better resilience
with httpx.Client(timeout=30.0) as client:
```

**However, this doesn't solve the root cause** - the test agent needs to be fixed.

## Timeline

- **8:40 PM PST**: Issue detected via curl test
- **8:45 PM PST**: Confirmed all endpoints timing out
- **8:50 PM PST**: Verified network connectivity working
- **8:55 PM PST**: Determined root cause is application layer issue

## Next Steps

1. ‚è≥ **Wait for test agent to be restored** (infrastructure team)
2. ‚úÖ **Use mock adapter for development** (immediate workaround)
3. üìß **Report issue to test agent maintainers** (if contact available)

## Testing Workaround

To continue development, use mock adapter instead of test agent:

```python
# In tenant configuration, switch from test agent to mock adapter
# Mock adapter provides realistic simulation without external dependencies
```

The mock adapter (`src/adapters/mock_ad_server.py`) provides:
- Realistic response simulation
- Configurable performance characteristics
- No external dependencies
- Perfect for development and testing

---

**Conclusion**: This is an infrastructure issue on the test agent side. Our system is working correctly - it's timing out appropriately when the external agent doesn't respond. The test agent needs to be fixed by its maintainers.
