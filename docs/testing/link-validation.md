# Automatic Link Validation in Integration Tests

## Problem

The creative review 404 issue (PR #421) showed that broken links can reach production:
- Blueprint wasn't registered in Flask app
- Links in templates pointed to non-existent routes
- No test caught this before deployment
- Only discovered when users clicked the link in production

**This type of bug should be caught by automated testing.**

## Solution: Automatic Link Validation

We now automatically validate **every link** on every page during integration testing:
- Extract all `<a href>`, `<img src>`, `<link href>`, `<script src>` attributes
- Validate internal links return valid HTTP status codes
- Report broken links with line numbers for debugging
- Runs as part of standard integration test suite

## How It Works

### 1. HTML Parsing
```python
from tests.integration.link_validator import LinkValidator

validator = LinkValidator(authenticated_admin_session)
response = client.get('/tenant/123')

# Extract all links from HTML
broken_links = validator.validate_response(response)
```

### 2. Link Classification
**Validated (internal links):**
- `/tenant/123/products` - Absolute paths
- `../settings` - Relative paths
- `./review` - Current directory references

**Skipped (external/special):**
- `https://google.com` - External links
- `javascript:void(0)` - JavaScript links
- `mailto:user@example.com` - Email links
- `#section` - Anchor-only links
- `data:image/png;...` - Data URLs

### 3. Validation
For each internal link:
1. Normalize URL (resolve relative paths)
2. Make HEAD request (faster than GET)
3. Check HTTP status code:
   - ‚úÖ 200, 302, 304, 401, 403: Valid (route exists)
   - ‚ùå 404, 500: Broken (route missing or broken)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è 501: Not Implemented (optional, configurable)

### 4. Reporting
```
Broken links found on /tenant/123:

  [404] /tenant/123/creatives/review (line 42, <a href=...>)
       Error: Status 404
  [500] /tenant/123/broken-api (line 87, <script src=...>)
       Error: Status 500

Total: 2 broken links
```

## Usage

### In New Tests
```python
def test_my_page_links_valid(authenticated_admin_session):
    """Test all links on my page are valid."""
    validator = LinkValidator(authenticated_admin_session)

    # Fetch and validate page
    broken_links = validator.validate_page('/my/page')

    # Assert no broken links
    assert not broken_links, format_broken_links_report(
        broken_links, '/my/page'
    )
```

### In Existing Tests
```python
def test_dashboard_renders(authenticated_admin_session):
    """Test dashboard renders correctly."""
    response = authenticated_admin_session.get('/tenant/123')
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # Add link validation
    validator = LinkValidator(authenticated_admin_session)
    broken_links = validator.validate_response(response)
    assert not broken_links, format_broken_links_report(
        broken_links, '/tenant/123'
    )
```

### Allow Specific Status Codes
```python
# Allow 404s (for optional routes)
broken_links = validator.validate_page(
    '/tenant/123',
    allow_404=True
)

# Disallow 501s (require all routes implemented)
broken_links = validator.validate_page(
    '/tenant/123',
    allow_501=False
)
```

## What Gets Validated

### ‚úÖ Validated
- All `<a href="...">` links
- All `<img src="...">` images
- All `<link href="...">` stylesheets/icons
- All `<script src="...">` scripts

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped
- External links (`http://`, `https://`, `//`)
- JavaScript links (`javascript:`)
- Email links (`mailto:`)
- Phone links (`tel:`)
- Anchor links (`#section`)
- Data URLs (`data:image/...`)

## Coverage

### Current Test Coverage
**Dedicated link validation tests** (`test_link_validation.py`):
- Dashboard
- Settings
- Products
- Principals
- Media Buys
- Workflows
- Inventory
- Authorized Properties
- Property Tags
- **Creative Review** (the route that was broken!)

**Comprehensive route tests** (`test_admin_ui_routes_comprehensive.py`):
- Dashboard links validated
- Settings links validated
- Products page links validated

### Adding to More Tests
You can add link validation to any integration test that renders HTML:
1. Import `LinkValidator` and `format_broken_links_report`
2. Create validator with test client
3. Validate response or page URL
4. Assert no broken links

## Benefits

### 1. Catches Blueprint Registration Issues
**Before**: Blueprint not registered ‚Üí 404 in production
**After**: Blueprint not registered ‚Üí test fails immediately

### 2. Catches Template Errors
**Before**: Typo in URL ‚Üí broken link in production
**After**: Typo in URL ‚Üí test fails with line number

### 3. Catches Refactoring Issues
**Before**: Rename route, forget to update template ‚Üí broken link
**After**: Rename route, forget to update template ‚Üí test fails

### 4. No Manual Testing Required
**Before**: Click every link on every page manually
**After**: Automated validation on every test run

### 5. Clear Error Messages
Instead of:
```
assert response.status_code == 200
AssertionError
```

You get:
```
Broken links found on /tenant/123:
  [404] /tenant/123/creatives/review (line 42, <a href=...>)

Total: 1 broken link
```

## Performance

### Fast Validation
- Uses HEAD requests (faster than GET)
- Only validates HTML responses (skips JSON/images)
- Only validates internal links (skips external)
- Runs in parallel with other integration tests

### Typical Performance
- **Per page**: 50-200ms (depending on link count)
- **Full suite**: +2-5 seconds (10 pages √ó 100-500ms each)
- **Worth it**: Catches real bugs before production

## Limitations

### JavaScript-Generated Links
**Not caught**: Links created by JavaScript after page load
**Reason**: We only parse static HTML, not execute JavaScript
**Workaround**: Add E2E tests with browser automation for critical JS flows

### Dynamic Content
**Not caught**: Links that appear conditionally (A/B tests, feature flags)
**Reason**: We only validate what's rendered for the test user
**Workaround**: Test with different user configurations

### External Links
**Not validated**: Links to external sites (Google, CDNs, etc.)
**Reason**: External sites may be slow/unavailable/rate-limited
**Workaround**: Use separate external link checker (not in CI)

## Recommendations

### 1. Add to Key Pages
Validate links on:
- ‚úÖ Dashboard (high traffic)
- ‚úÖ Settings (critical functionality)
- ‚úÖ List pages (products, principals, media buys)
- ‚úÖ Detail pages (product detail, media buy detail)

### 2. Run in CI
Link validation tests run automatically in CI:
```bash
./run_all_tests.sh ci  # Includes link validation
```

### 3. Fix Broken Links Immediately
When a link validation test fails:
1. Check the error message (includes line number!)
2. Fix the broken link (register blueprint, fix URL, etc.)
3. Verify test passes
4. **Never skip the test** - fix the underlying issue

### 4. Add to New Features
When adding a new feature:
1. Register blueprint in `app.py`
2. Add routes in blueprint file
3. Add templates with links
4. **Add link validation test** to catch issues early

## Real-World Example: PR #421

### What Happened
1. `creatives_bp` blueprint existed but wasn't registered in `app.py`
2. Templates had links to `/tenant/<id>/creatives/review`
3. Links returned 404 in production
4. No test caught this

### What Would Have Happened With Link Validation
1. `test_dashboard_links_valid()` would have run
2. Dashboard contains link to creative review
3. Validator would have tested `/tenant/123/creatives/review`
4. **Test would have failed with clear error:**
   ```
   Broken links found on /tenant/123:
     [404] /tenant/123/creatives/review (line 42, <a href=...>)
   ```
5. Developer would have registered blueprint **before** deploying

### Lesson Learned
**Automated link validation catches blueprint registration issues before production.**

## Summary

‚úÖ **Automatic link validation catches broken links before production**
