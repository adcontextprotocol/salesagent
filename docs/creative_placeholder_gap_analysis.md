# Creative Placeholder Gap Analysis

## Problem Summary

The format extensibility system allows configuring 1x1 placeholders for GAM native templates, but the creative validation system will reject real creatives that don't match 1x1 dimensions.

## Current Flow

### 1. Line Item Creation (orders.py)
```python
# We correctly create 1x1 placeholder with template ID
if "creative_template_id" in placeholder_cfg:
    placeholder["size"] = {"width": 1, "height": 1, "isAspectRatio": False}
    placeholder["creativeTemplateId"] = placeholder_cfg["creative_template_id"]
```

‚úÖ **Works correctly** - GAM line item created with proper 1x1 placeholder + template ID

### 2. Creative Sync (creatives.py lines 267-323)
```python
def _validate_creative_size_against_placeholders(asset, creative_placeholders):
    asset_width, asset_height = self._get_creative_dimensions(asset, None)

    # Check if dimensions match placeholder
    if asset_width == placeholder_width and asset_height == placeholder_height:
        matching_placeholders_found = True
```

‚ùå **FAILS** - Buyer sends 300x250 creative, but placeholder is 1x1, so `300 != 1`

### 3. GAM Creative Association (creatives.py line 624)
```python
lica_service.createLineItemCreativeAssociations([association])
```

üî≤ **NEVER REACHED** - Validation fails before we get here

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Native Ads with Template
**Publisher Setup:**
- Product configured with format override: `creative_template_id: 12345678`
- Line item created with 1x1 placeholder + template ID

**Buyer Action:**
- Sends native creative via `sync_creatives` with actual dimensions (e.g., 1200x627 for Facebook-style native)

**Current Result:**
```
‚ùå Creative validation failed: Creative size 1200x627 does not match any LineItem placeholders.
   Available sizes in assigned packages: 1x1
```

**What Should Happen:**
‚úÖ Accept the creative and associate it with the 1x1 placeholder (GAM native template will handle rendering)

### Scenario 2: Programmatic/Header Bidding
**Publisher Setup:**
- Product for programmatic inventory with 1x1 placeholders (no template ID)
- Buyer will send third-party tags that render at runtime

**Buyer Action:**
- Sends creative with `third_party_url` and dimensions 300x250

**Current Result:**
```
‚ùå Creative validation failed: Creative size 300x250 does not match any LineItem placeholders.
   Available sizes in assigned packages: 1x1
```

**What Should Happen:**
‚úÖ Accept the creative - 1x1 is a wildcard for programmatic

### Scenario 3: Standard Display (No Issues)
**Publisher Setup:**
- Standard format: `display_300x250` with normal 300x250 placeholder

**Buyer Action:**
- Sends 300x250 creative

**Current Result:**
‚úÖ Works correctly - dimensions match

## Root Cause

The validation logic in `_validate_creative_size_against_placeholders()` treats 1x1 as a literal size requirement instead of recognizing it as a special GAM pattern with different semantics:

1. **1x1 + template_id** = GAM native creative template (accepts any dimensions)
2. **1x1 without template_id** = Programmatic/third-party tag (accepts any dimensions)
3. **Normal dimensions** = Strict size match required

## Proposed Solution

### Option 1: Skip Size Validation for 1x1 Placeholders (Recommended)

Update `_validate_creative_size_against_placeholders()`:

```python
def _validate_creative_size_against_placeholders(asset, creative_placeholders):
    # ... existing dimension extraction ...

    for package_id in package_assignments:
        placeholders = creative_placeholders.get(package_id, [])
        for placeholder in placeholders:
            placeholder_size = placeholder.get("size", {})
            placeholder_width = placeholder_size.get("width", 0)
            placeholder_height = placeholder_size.get("height", 0)

            # 1x1 placeholders are wildcards (native templates or programmatic)
            if placeholder_width == 1 and placeholder_height == 1:
                matching_placeholders_found = True
                logger.info(
                    f"Creative {asset_width}x{asset_height} matches 1x1 wildcard placeholder "
                    f"(native template or programmatic)"
                )
                break

            # Standard placeholders require exact match
            if asset_width == placeholder_width and asset_height == placeholder_height:
                matching_placeholders_found = True
                break
```

**Pros:**
- Simple and correct for GAM semantics
- Handles both native templates and programmatic
- No configuration changes needed

**Cons:**
- Could accidentally accept wrong-sized creatives if 1x1 used incorrectly

### Option 2: Check for creative_template_id in Placeholder

Store template_id in placeholder metadata during line item creation, check it during validation:

```python
# In orders.py line item creation
if "creative_template_id" in placeholder_cfg:
    placeholder["size"] = {"width": 1, "height": 1}
    placeholder["creativeTemplateId"] = placeholder_cfg["creative_template_id"]
    placeholder["_is_native_template"] = True  # Metadata flag
```

```python
# In creatives.py validation
if placeholder.get("_is_native_template") or (placeholder_width == 1 and placeholder_height == 1):
    # Accept any size for native templates or 1x1 wildcards
    matching_placeholders_found = True
```

**Pros:**
- More explicit about template vs non-template 1x1
- Could add stricter validation in future

**Cons:**
- More complex
- Requires passing metadata through line item creation

### Option 3: Format-Based Validation Logic

Check the format type during validation:

```python
def _validate_creative_size_against_placeholders(asset, creative_placeholders, format_obj):
    # If format has creative_template_id, skip size validation
    if format_obj.platform_config.get("gam", {}).get("creative_placeholder", {}).get("creative_template_id"):
        return []  # No validation errors for template-based formats

    # Otherwise, strict size matching
    # ... existing validation ...
```

**Pros:**
- Most semantically correct - validation based on format configuration
- Could handle other special cases per format

**Cons:**
- Requires passing format_obj through validation pipeline
- More refactoring needed

## Recommendation

**Implement Option 1** because:
1. It's the simplest and matches GAM's actual behavior
2. 1x1 placeholders ARE wildcards in GAM - this is not a hack, it's how GAM works
3. No refactoring or data passing changes needed
4. Works for all three use cases (native templates, programmatic, standard)

## Additional Considerations

### Do Buyers Understand 1x1 Hacks?

**No, they shouldn't need to!** This is exactly why we need this fix:

- Buyer sees format: `"native_in_feed"` with requirements: `{"width": 1200, "height": 627}`
- Buyer sends creative with those dimensions
- **Internal GAM mapping** (via platform_config) uses 1x1 placeholder
- Validation should handle this translation transparently

### What About Creative IDs in create_media_buy?

Currently, `Package.creative_ids` is **not used** during line item creation. Creatives are associated later via `sync_creatives`. This is correct because:

1. **Line items need placeholders** - these define what creatives are expected
2. **Creatives come later** - buyer uploads/syncs creatives after media buy is created
3. **Association is async** - `sync_creatives` ‚Üí validates ‚Üí creates GAM creative ‚Üí associates with line item

If buyer provides `creative_ids` in `create_media_buy` request, we should:
- ‚úÖ Store them in the database (`Package.creative_ids`)
- ‚úÖ Return them in responses
- ‚ùå **Do NOT** try to associate them during order/line item creation (creatives don't exist yet in GAM)
- ‚úÖ Associate them when `sync_creatives` is called

### What If Creatives Are Added Later?

**Current behavior is correct:**

1. `create_media_buy` ‚Üí Creates GAM order + line items with placeholders
2. Buyer creates creatives via AdCP creative endpoints
3. `sync_creatives` ‚Üí Validates + uploads + associates with line items
4. Buyer can call `sync_creatives` multiple times to add/update

**No code changes needed** - this flow already works correctly (except for 1x1 validation bug).

## Implementation Plan

1. ‚úÖ Fix `_validate_creative_size_against_placeholders()` to treat 1x1 as wildcard
2. ‚úÖ Add logging to indicate when 1x1 wildcard matching is used
3. ‚úÖ Add tests for 1x1 placeholder scenarios
4. ‚úÖ Document that 1x1 is transparent to buyers (internal GAM mapping)

## Test Cases Needed

```python
def test_creative_validation_accepts_1x1_wildcard_for_native_template():
    """1x1 placeholder with template_id accepts any creative size."""
    placeholder = {"size": {"width": 1, "height": 1}, "creativeTemplateId": 12345678}
    asset = {"width": 1200, "height": 627}  # Native creative
    # Should validate successfully

def test_creative_validation_accepts_1x1_wildcard_for_programmatic():
    """1x1 placeholder without template_id accepts any creative size."""
    placeholder = {"size": {"width": 1, "height": 1}}
    asset = {"width": 300, "height": 250, "third_party_url": "..."}
    # Should validate successfully

def test_creative_validation_requires_exact_match_for_standard():
    """Non-1x1 placeholders require exact dimension match."""
    placeholder = {"size": {"width": 300, "height": 250}}
    asset = {"width": 728, "height": 90}  # Wrong size
    # Should fail validation
```
