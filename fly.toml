# fly.toml app configuration file for AdCP Sales Agent
#
# See https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/ for information about how to use this file.
#
# Port Architecture:
#   - Port 8000: nginx reverse proxy (external-facing, what Fly routes to)
#   - Port 8080: MCP server (internal, behind nginx)
#   - Port 8001: Admin UI (internal, behind nginx)
#   - Port 8091: A2A server (internal, behind nginx)
#
# The *_PORT env vars configure where internal services bind. nginx proxies
# external requests on 8000 to the appropriate internal service by path.
