"""Unified MCP client utility for consistent agent communication.

This module provides a single, standardized way to create MCP clients for
communicating with external agents (creative agents, signals agents, etc.).

Key features:
- Consistent URL handling (uses user's URL; if it fails after retries, does one
  final fallback attempt by appending "/mcp" when missing)
- Standardized auth header building
- Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff
- Proper error handling and logging
- Testable in isolation

Usage:
    from src.core.utils.mcp_client import create_mcp_client

    async with create_mcp_client(
        agent_url="https://example.com/mcp",
        auth={"type": "bearer", "credentials": "token123"},
        timeout=30
    ) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("tool_name", params)
