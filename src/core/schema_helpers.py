"""Helper functions for working with generated schemas.

This module provides convenience functions for constructing complex generated schemas
without losing type safety. Unlike adapters (which wrap schemas in dict[str, Any]),
these helpers work directly with the generated Pydantic models.

Philosophy:
- Generated schemas are the source of truth (always in sync with AdCP spec)
- Helpers make construction easier without sacrificing type safety
- Custom logic (validators, conversions) lives here, not in wrapper classes
