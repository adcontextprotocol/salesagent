# GAM Inventory Sync Memory Optimization

## Problem

The application crashed with OOM (Out of Memory) error on Fly.io:
```
Out of memory: Killed process 680 (python) total-vm:3878316kB, anon-rss:3434004kB
```

**Root Cause**: The GAM inventory sync process loaded ALL inventory data into memory at once before writing to the database. With large GAM networks (10k+ ad units, placements, custom targeting data), memory usage exceeded 3.4GB.

## Solution: Streaming Inventory Sync

Implemented a **streaming approach** that processes and writes inventory data in chunks:

### Key Changes

**File**: `src/services/gam_inventory_service.py`

#### 1. New Streaming Sync Method (`_streaming_sync_all_inventory`)

Instead of loading all inventory types into memory simultaneously, we now:

1. **Fetch ad units** from GAM → **Write to DB** → **Clear from memory**
2. **Fetch placements** from GAM → **Write to DB** → **Clear from memory**
3. **Fetch labels** from GAM → **Write to DB** → **Clear from memory**
4. **Fetch custom targeting keys** (NOT values) → **Write to DB** → **Clear from memory**
5. **Fetch audience segments** (first-party only) → **Write to DB** → **Clear from memory**

**Memory Impact**: Peak memory usage stays bounded regardless of inventory size. Each inventory type is processed independently.

#### 2. Batch Writing with Immediate Flush

- **Batch size**: 500 items per database write
- **Immediate commits**: Each batch is committed as soon as it's written
- **Memory cleanup**: Data structures are cleared after each batch

#### 3. Lazy Loading for Custom Targeting Values

Custom targeting values can be MASSIVE (100k+ values across all keys). These are now:
- **Keys synced during full sync** (metadata only)
- **Values lazy loaded on demand** when user requests them (via `/api/tenant/{id}/targeting/values/{key_id}` endpoint)

This alone can save 1-2GB of memory for large networks.

### New Helper Methods

1. **`_write_inventory_batch()`**: Efficiently writes a batch of inventory items with proper upsert logic
2. **`_write_custom_targeting_keys()`**: Specialized writer for custom targeting keys
3. **`_convert_item_to_db_format()`**: Converts GAM API objects to database format
4. **`_flush_batch()`**: Commits batches to database with error handling
5. **`_mark_stale_inventory()`**: Marks old inventory as stale after sync
6. **`_upsert_inventory_item()`**: Single-item upsert for lazy loading

## Memory Savings Estimate

**Before** (single large sync):
- Ad units: ~500MB (10k items with metadata)
- Placements: ~200MB (5k items)
- Labels: ~50MB (1k items)
- Custom targeting: **~2GB** (keys + ALL values)
- Audience segments: ~100MB (1k items)
- **Total: ~3GB peak memory**

**After** (streaming sync):
- Each type processed independently: ~500MB peak per type
- Custom targeting values NOT loaded: **saves ~1.5GB**
- **Total: ~500MB peak memory** (6x reduction)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Large Inventory**:
   ```bash
   # Trigger manual sync via admin UI or API
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/tenant/{tenant_id}/inventory/sync \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
   ```

2. **Monitor Memory Usage**:
   ```bash
   # On Fly.io
   fly logs --app adcp-sales-agent | grep -i "memory\|oom"

   # Check metrics
   fly status --app adcp-sales-agent
   ```

3. **Verify Sync Works**:
   - Check admin UI inventory browser
   - Verify ad units show up correctly
   - Test custom targeting lazy loading (click on a key to load values)

## Deployment Notes

**Current RAM Allocation**: 1GB (Fly.io default)

**After this fix**: Should run comfortably within 1GB even with large inventories. If needed, can scale to 2GB for safety:

```bash
fly scale memory 2048 -a adcp-sales-agent
```

But this should NO LONGER be necessary with streaming sync.

## Additional Optimizations Applied

1. **Excluded ARCHIVED ad units** - Reduces sync payload by excluding inactive items
2. **First-party audience segments only** - Skips Google's massive 3rd party catalog
3. **Batched database writes** - Uses SQLAlchemy bulk operations for efficiency
4. **Incremental sync support** - GAM API supports `lastModifiedDateTime` filter (not yet enabled)

## Performance Impact

**Sync Time**: Should remain similar or slightly faster due to:
- Immediate database commits (no large transaction at end)
- Reduced memory pressure = less GC overhead
- Same number of API calls to GAM

**Database Load**: Slightly higher due to more frequent commits, but well within PostgreSQL capacity.

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- Old `_save_inventory_to_db()` method kept for reference
- New streaming sync is drop-in replacement
- Same API response format
- Same database schema

## Future Enhancements

1. **Incremental Sync**: Use `since` parameter to fetch only items modified since last sync
2. **Parallel Processing**: Process different inventory types in parallel threads
3. **Compression**: Compress inventory metadata before storing in JSONB columns
4. **Pagination Tuning**: Adjust GAM API page size based on memory pressure
